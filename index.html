	<h1>Hi, I'm <a href="https://adhishreeapte.github.io/">Adhishree</a></h1>
	<input type="image" src="self1.jpg" alt="Submit" style="width:200px;height:200px;margin-left:15px;">
	<p>I graduated from <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay</a>, with a dual degree (BTech + MTech) in Chemical Engineering. At IIT-B, I was part of an <a href = "http://www.auv-iitb.org/">awesome team</a> who manufactured <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_underwater_vehicle">Autonomous Underwater Vehicles</a> every year for the annual <a href = "https://robosub.org/">Robosub competition</a> representing India. I worked on the fifth iteration of the vehicle called <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/13vkLbQlGt7DVxbpWEMn5CtTs42Z3Po71">Matsya 5.0</a>. I also undertook several <a href="https://dampiitbche.wordpress.com/">Mentoring</a> and Teaching activities. In junior year I worked as <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1smnojXSr454dGWxizOCmLP7cjTATTkHX/view?usp=sharing">Undergraduate Research Assistant</a> with Prof. Abhijit Majumder. </p>

	<p>A lot of my projects involve simulation and producing videos, some of which are on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjSsugKO3oEASKBJZA24DDg">Youtube Channel</a>. </p>
  
  	<p>You can get me interested in virtually anything taking about - 
	  1. Impact 
	  2. Mathematics underlying it 
		in that order :P <p>
	  
	<p>My previous <b>research experiences</b> include optical properties of aerosols, biomaterials and microbiome. 
	<p> I have worked for a year as a Control System Architect for <a href="https://www.sedemac.com/">SEDEMAC</a>, a motor controls company. There I developed python package for large testing data, developed Model Based System Engineering code on SIMULINK, tuned sensorless motor control algorithms named Bemf and BHSpin for IC Engine two wheelers, tested hardware, developed theramal derating algorithms, interacted with R&D and System Engineers at TVS on several business visits. </p>

 	
	<p>My <b>hobbies</b> include trekking and nature trailing. Another quirky activity I spend a lot of time on is learning different languages. I like to think this stems from a curiosity about different cultures. The to-learn list currently includes Japanese.<p> 
	<p> I start my day as well as end it with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_as_exercise">Yoga</a>. I also play Table Tennis and Badminton and  Swim occasionally. I also love to memorise Marathi Poems and Songs and recite them off the top of my head.<p>
	<p>If you have managed to reach this line, we seem to have some common interests... so feel free to drop me an email at apteadhishree@gmail.com and I would love to know you!
