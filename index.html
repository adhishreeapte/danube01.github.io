	<h1>Hi, I'm <a href="https://danube01.github.io/">Adhishree</a></h1>
	<input type="image" src="self1.jpg" alt="Submit" style="width:200px;height:200px;margin-left:15px;">
	<p>I'm a senior undergraduate student at <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay</a>, studying Chemical Engineering. At IIT-B, I was part of an <a href = "http://www.auv-iitb.org/">awesome team</a> who manufactured <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_underwater_vehicle">Autonomous Underwater Vehicles</a> every year for the annual <a href = "https://robosub.org/">Robosub competition</a> representing India. I worked on the fifth iteration of the vehicle called <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/13vkLbQlGt7DVxbpWEMn5CtTs42Z3Po71">Matsya 5.0</a>. I also undertook several <a href="https://dampiitbche.wordpress.com/">Mentoring</a> and Teaching activities. In junior year I worked as <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1smnojXSr454dGWxizOCmLP7cjTATTkHX/view?usp=sharing">Undergraduate Research Assistant</a> with Prof. Abhijit Majumder. During senior year Summer I worked as a <a href="https://www.hul.co.in/careers/student-opportunities/internships/">ULIP intern</a> with Unilever Bangalore team at the end of which I was offered a pre-placement interview. </p>

	<p>A lot of my projects involve simulation and producing videos, most mesmerising of which are compiled on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjSsugKO3oEASKBJZA24DDg">Youtube Channel</a>. </p>
  
  	<p>You can get me interested in virtually anything by answering 2 questions- 
	  1. Practical Utility of the endeavour? 
	  2. Mathematics of it?  
		in that order :P <p>
	  
	<p>My <b>research interests</b> include Aerosols Science, Air Quality, Environmental Fluid Mechanics and Atmospheric Chemistry.  

 	<p>Well thumbed <b>Nonfiction</b> books include Seven Habits of Highly Effective People and Six Thinking Hats through which I hope to master being efficient and have more time to pursue my hobbies. You can find other books I have read and plan to read in the Reading Section.<p>

	<p>My <b>hobbies</b> include trekking and nature trailing and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kokani_coconut/">picture-blogging</a> about it later. Another quirky activity I spend a lot of time on is learning different languages. I like to think this stems from a curiosity about different cultures. The to-learn list currently includes Japanese and French. Sometimes I write poems which very soon seem embarrassing to me and other compiled musings from various places on the web which you can find <a href= "https://saltonmylips.blogspot.com/">here</a>. 
	<p> I start my day as well as end it with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_as_exercise">Yoga</a>. I also play Table Tennis and Badminton and  Swim occasionally. I also love to memorise Marathi Poems and Songs and recite them off the top of my head.<p>
	<p>If you have managed to reach this line, we seem to have some common interests... so feel free to drop me an email at apteadhishree@gmail.com and I would love to know you!
